	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>Being Mechanical designer I was enjoying my work but what always was hitting back in my mind is that my work is being automated. So, I was looking to upskill myself by learning any course which
	 pushed me to find a developing course, which I thought will be challenging for me and always a going to be a growing technology as all Industries have started to automate and use softwares.</p>
